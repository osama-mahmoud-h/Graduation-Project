# Business Description

Our business provides a social media platform where users can create profiles, share posts, and interact with other users. We have developed a backend system using Spring Boot and have exposed several interfaces for our frontend developers to use.

## UserService

The `UserService` interface provides methods for user authentication, registration, and retrieval. Our frontend developers can use these methods to enable user login and registration features.

## ProfileService

The `ProfileService` interface provides methods for managing user profiles. Our frontend developers can use these methods to allow users to upload profile pictures, update their bios and skills, and view their followers and following users.

## PostService

The `PostService` interface provides methods for managing user posts. Our frontend developers can use these methods to allow users to create, view, and update their posts. Users can also like and comment on other users' posts using these methods.

## CommentService

The `CommentService` interface provides methods for managing user comments. Our frontend developers can use these methods to allow users to create, view, update, and delete their comments on other users' posts.

Overall, our backend system provides the necessary interfaces to create a full-featured social media platform. Our frontend developers can utilize these interfaces to create a seamless user experience, while our backend team ensures the reliability and scalability of the system.
